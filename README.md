# Programa de Férias - PET Informática

The PET-Informatica summer course is an introduction to programming and development for students of high school. We try to motivate students and to show them that programming is not only for computer students!

This website is hosted at: https://pet-informatica.github.io/programa-de-ferias

In order to run this project you must install node.js avaiable here: https://nodejs.org/en/

Then
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Travel to it's folder from terminal command line
  3. run 'npm install -g gulp'
  4. run 'npm install'
  5. run 'npm run dev'

All the necessary dependencies will be downloaded automatically, and any changes in scc, js or html will be watched by gulp. The resulting files will be minified and packed at bin/ folder. If you want to update the website, just make sure that bin/ is updated running 'npm run dev' and checking index.html, and then copy everything inside it to https://github.com/pet-informatica/pet-informatica.github.io/tree/master/programa-de-ferias
